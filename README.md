## 👩🏽‍💻 About Me

I am a data-driven professional with a strong foundation in data analysis, business intelligence, and digital strategy. With practical experience in Excel, Power BI, SQL, and Python, I specialize in transforming complex data into clear, actionable insights that drive strategic outcomes.

I have worked on diverse projects including business performance analysis, customer segmentation, and predictive modeling. My approach combines analytical thinking with effective data storytelling to communicate findings to both both technical and non-technical audiences.

I'm also a writer and digital storyteller. Through my Substack newsletter and other platforms, I break down data concepts, share behind-the-scenes insights from my projects, and reflect on the intersection of data, life, and creativity. My goal is to make data relatable and to inspire others through both analysis and words.

Certified in both data analytics and digital marketing, I bring a unique, interdisciplinary perspective to solving business challenges. I’m passionate about using data to influence decisions, optimize performance, and uncover growth opportunities. I'm currently open to freelance projects, mid-level roles, and consulting opportunities where I can contribute meaningfully and deliver measurable value.
